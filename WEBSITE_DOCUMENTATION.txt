📋 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT
==============================================

HIGH PRIORITY:

1. RESUME DOWNLOAD FUNCTIONALITY 📄
   - The "Download Resume" button currently doesn't have an actual PDF file
   - ACTION NEEDED: Upload your resume PDF to the assets folder
   - Update the button link in src/pages/About.tsx

2. GITHUB PROFILE LINK 🔗
   - Footer and About page link to generic https://github.com
   - ACTION NEEDED: Update to your actual GitHub profile URL
   - Files to update: src/components/Footer.tsx, src/pages/Contact.tsx

3. PROJECT DETAIL PAGE REFACTORING 🔧
   - ✅ COMPLETED: The ProjectDetail.tsx file has been refactored
   - Now broken into 7 smaller, focused components:
     * ProjectHeader.tsx
     * TechnologyTags.tsx
     * Model3DSection.tsx
     * ConceptSection.tsx
     * LayoutSection.tsx
     * ChallengesSection.tsx
     * ProjectActions.tsx

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

4. GOOGLE ANALYTICS INTEGRATION 📊
   - Analytics code exists but needs verification
   - Ensure tracking is working for page views and contact form submissions

5. DOMAIN EMAIL SETUP 🌐
   - Currently using onboarding@resend.dev for emails
   - When you deploy to production with a custom domain:
     a. Verify your domain in Resend dashboard
     b. Update sender address in src/convex/sendEmails.ts
     c. Change from: "PCB Nexus Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>"
     d. To: "PCB Nexus Contact <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

6. 3D MODEL LOADING 🎨
   - Only one 3D model currently available (High_Speed_Ethernet_Interface.glb)
   - Consider adding 3D models for other projects
   - Upload to public/assets/ folder

LOW PRIORITY (POLISH):

7. SEO OPTIMIZATION 🔍
   - Add meta descriptions to pages
   - Include Open Graph tags for social sharing
   - Add structured data for projects

8. LOADING STATES ⏳
   - Add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
   - Currently using Loader2 spinner (good, but could be enhanced)

9. ERROR HANDLING ⚠️
   - Add user-friendly error messages for failed form submissions
   - Currently shows toast notifications (good foundation)
